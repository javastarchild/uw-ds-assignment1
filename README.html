About tweet_sentiment.py: 
<p>
The python program tweet_sentiment.py accepts two arguments on the command line: a sentiment file and a tweet file with json from twitter api.
<p>
You can run the program like this:
<p>

<code>$ python tweet_sentiment.py AFINN-111.txt output.txt</code>

<p>
The file AFINN-111.txt contains a list of pre-computed sentiment scores. Each line in the file contains a word or phrase followed by a sentiment score. Each word or phrase that is found in a tweet but not found in AFINN-111.txt should be given a sentiment score of 0. See the file AFINN-README.txt for more information.
<p>
To use the data in the AFINN-111.txt file, you may find it useful to build a dictionary. Note that the AFINN-111.txt file format is tab-delimited, meaning that the term and the score are separated by a tab character.
